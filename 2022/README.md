# Advent of code 2022

My solutions for advent of code 2022. Written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
For most problems I have an `initial solution` commit which contains the code that got me the answers.  
For some problems I will take another look to refactor, add comments, optimize etc that will be in later commits for
that solution.
