# Advent of code

Here are my solutions to advent of code.

To run any solution
1. Make sure [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is installed.
1. cd into the folder for the year ex: `cd 2022`
1. Place input as `Input.txt` in the folder for the day.
   1. You can also create an environment variable called `AOC_SESSION` with the session token and the input will be automatically downloaded
1. run `cargo run -p day##` 
   - ex cargo run -p day1
